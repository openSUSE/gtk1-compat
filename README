GTK1 Compatibility Package

Compatibility Wrappers for Old Versions of GLib, GTK+, GDK-Pixbuf and
libglade

Wrapper headers, M4 macros, config scripts and library symlinks, which
simulate presence of GLib1, GTK+1, GDK-Pixbuf1, libglade1 development
packages, but tries to use GLib2, GTK+2 and libglade2.

Using it, you can force linking of some old applications with new
libraries without any effort.

Package also provides gtk1-compat-autofix script, which does some
source code modifications, which cannot be worked around by any other
way.

Package also provides gtk1-compat-autofix script, which does some
source code modifications, which cannot be worked around by any other
way, and a static library with some obsolete functions.


Usage:

Simply replace old devel packages by gtk1-compat in your system.
Programs will be compiled with GTK+2, if possible.

You may need to run gtk1-compat-autofix to modify sources to increase
your chance to compile a package with gtk1-compat.

Don't expect that you will be able to compile all projects!


Environment:

GTK1_COMPAT_DISABLE_C_SUPPORT: If set and non empty, disable C header
emulation, provide only *-config scripts.

GTK1_COMPAT_THREAD_SUPPORT: If set and non empty, try to link GTK+1
applications with gthread library.
